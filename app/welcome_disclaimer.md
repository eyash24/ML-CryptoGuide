Predictions made by the single-coin model and the multi-coin model may differ significantly due to differences in the data used and the assumptions each model captures.

Single coin model has been trained exclusively on the histrocial data of a single cryptocurrency. Henceforth, it is more tailored towards capturing that coin's trends, seasonality and behavior.
Mutlicoin has been trained on a merged dataset consisting historical price data of BTC, ETH and LTC. It learns the general market trend.
